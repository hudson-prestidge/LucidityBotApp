# LucidityBotApp


okay let's work out some stats we can serve!

currently complete:


currently in progress/partially complete:

Most Active users. Currently returns 5 user _ids_
Most used words. This is currently working, but only returns one word (and maybe not in the right format?) and needs refactoring
Users who bug the streamer the most. Currently returns 5 user _ids_
Stats about a particular user. Currently returns messagecount for a particular user but getting multiple stats would be cool.

ideas we can add:

Adding functionality for the bot to repeat a certain message every given time period would be sweet
Responsiveness/mobile friendliness is a cool feature
Authentication is mandatory but currently not practical

stats page:

channel stats (seperate routes?)

okay let's work out some stats we can serve!

currently complete:
Most Active users.
Most used words.
Users who bug the streamer the most.

currently in progress/partially complete:
Stats about a particular user. Currently returns messagecount for a particular user but getting multiple stats would be cool.

ideas we can add:

Responsiveness/mobile friendliness is a cool feature
Authentication is mandatory but currently not practical

stats page:
individual user stats
channel stats (seperate routes?)

home page:
welcome message

commands page:
create table of commands

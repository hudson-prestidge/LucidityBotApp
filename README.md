okay let's work out some stats we can serve!

currently complete:
Most Active users.
Most used words.
Users who bug the streamer the most.

currently in progress/partially complete:
Stats about a particular user. Currently returns messagecount for a particular user but getting multiple stats would be cool.

ideas we can add:

Responsiveness/mobile friendliness is a cool feature
Auth is underway, 90% complete
So much styling!

updates for Commands Table:
scrollable list? pages of commands? giant wall of commands is not terribly approachable
scheduled command implementation + list of them
restful routes for commands

updates for stats page:
I want more graphs and more varied graphs!


stats page:
individual user stats
channel stats (seperate routes?)

home page:
welcome message

commands page:
create table of commands

        <p>Welcome to the Lucidity Bot Homepage and control panel! This bot was a project by our esteemed leader Charcon. If you have
        suggestions to improve its functionality feel free to pm him about it on twitch. It will most likely be improved over time anyway
        as he has time.</p>
        <p>From this page you can manage Luciditybot. If you want to add her to your channel, add/remove commands or simply view the
        commands she has available for your channel, this is the place to do it.</p>
        <p>The other function this site serves is to showcase various statistics gathered from the messages logged while the bot
        was in your channel.  The statistics that are available to view are liable to change over time, and again reasonable suggestions
        are welcomed.</p>
